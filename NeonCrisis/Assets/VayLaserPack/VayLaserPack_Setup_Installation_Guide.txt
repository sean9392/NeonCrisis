After installation follow these steps. 

Now you can either open up an "Example Scene" I have provided for you by

	-Heading over to "Scene" folder and opening up "Example Scene"

	After opening up the "ExampleScene" 
	- Hit Play

	Camera Controls 
	- "W", "A", "S", "D" to move around 
	- "ESC" to pause / enable mouse cursor
	- "Left Shift" to raise
	- "Left Ctrl" to lower

	-From here you are free to modify your laser however you want 
	- You can change different laser properties
	- You can generate any type of laser you desire. 
	- After done customizing your laser, click on " Create Laser Prefab " to make your laser a prefab
	- Your laser prefab will be under Resources-> LaserPrefabs 
	- Drag your laser prefab in your scene and you will have multiple lasers 


If you decide not to use "Example Scene" and decide to use your own scene then follow these instructions 

	-Create a new Empty gameobject in your scene
	-Name it "LaserParticleManager"
	-Attach "Laser Particle Manager" to that gameobject
	-(Optional) Delete your Main Camera and Drag in the "GameCamera" prefab (Resource->Prefabs) for controls
